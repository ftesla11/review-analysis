The band itself (I have the Charge 2) is decent, works as described. For tracking steps and heart rate, it's what I need. 

For sleep, there are issues. First of all, I prefer to actually turn on the sleep mode. I've had this option on other bands. You tell the band you're going to sleep, it automatically turns off any vibrations or sounds to avoid disturbing your sleep, and tracks how long it took to fall asleep. The Fitbit app has no such function, but instead does ""sleep detection."" This does not work at all. It always shows me falling asleep at least 90 minutes later than I actually did. And, I have to remember to turn notifications off, and then turn them back on when I wake up. They recently upgraded their sleep analysis. I like the new analysis much better, but the app keeps switching back to the old one for no apparent reason. It bounces back and forth - a few days with the old approach, a few days with the new approach. The results are quite different, so this bouncing back and forth makes it impossible to compare sleep quality from one night to the next. 

I travel a lot, and the time zone doesn't update very well. This should really work much better.

I also wish all the challenges weren't step related. It would be fun if you could challenge friends to workouts (so many minutes or heart rate zones per week) and active minutes rather than just steps.

The adventure section is lacking. I'm a Canadian and so the Yosemite hikes or New York hikes are useless to me. But it was a cool idea.

Felt like I was buying an iPhone accessory. The app is top notch easy to use and has many options for the time clock face. You can input food, water intake, and it does the rest! Monitors my heart rate, steps, calories, and much more. Also provides special monitoring of exercise events for low and high moments in workout. The device even has breathing exercise for calming moments, as well as mini workouts it offers up to increase opportunities when you have 5-10 minutes to fit in a workout. The in depth sleep monitoring reports really provide a real good break down of my sleep periods. It has controls on the device itself to control your music play while listening! It's well worth the price. Popping out the module for charging is easy and gets you back up and running for 5 days after a 2 hour charge.

I HAVE TO SEND A SPECIFIED SQUARE OF THE PHOTO THAT I CANT CHANGE AND THEN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE PHOTO IS HALF CUT OFF!

It's a great method of calorie counting and I love having the ability to customize so many things to my lifestyle; such as creating recipes, creating exercises, and adjusting MACRO's. However, community plays a very large role in fitness and this App is terrible at maintaining a solid platform for community banter and communications. Teamwork is a valued asset for athletes and when friends are attempting to motivate each other thousands of miles apart, they must be able to rely on their social media capabilities. This App crashes constantly, it delays news feed updates, sometimes for days which makes supporting your fellow teammates extremely frustrating. By the time you see their accomplishments the excitement or activity has already come and gone. The App also glitches frequently when attempting to upload pictures, and often times will not allow you to upload anything at all when working with progress pictures or news feed images. In addition, there are ZERO pre-programmed strength exercises available - which for Bodybuilders like myself is extremely limiting when attempting to monitor our daily caloric burn.

I will of course continue to use this tool as it has become second nature for me to log daily, I am a fan of UnderArmor, and the app is, for the most part, user friendly.

I have been using this app for years, and after recently upgrading to premium, I have some issues with the layout and design of the app. My Fitness Pal was an excellent tool to track simply calories, however I now follow a strict ketogenic diet. I appreciate how I can adjust the macro grams to suit my dietary needs, but the layout of this app truly limits my food tracking. In a ketogenic diet, you measure ""net carbs"", which is essentially total grams of carbs minus total grams of fiber. Currently, there is no option to show net carbs, requiring me to do the subtraction. This is not difficult, however it could be a great feature one could 'turn on'. 

Another improvement could be to the water feature. I would love if I could set a goal for the amount of water I drink in a day, and see the amount of water as a fraction (i.e. 32 oz/100oz), so I can manage my water intake more easily. Or, even better, see a water bottle graphic that I could ""fill with water"" as I drink throughout the day.

My final suggestion is that My Fitness Pal is neither easy to navigate, nor aesthetically pleasing. This alone makes tracking food a chore. The bland user interface takes away from the app. There is a difference between something that works, and something you enjoy working with. In My Fitness Pal, everything works, however I don't enjoy the experience due to the uninteresting design, that has been that same for 5 years. A beautiful new redesign would be highly beneficial and increase the experience for all users.

 I appreciate My Fitness Pal for the unmatchable food accuracy and help on my journey to heath! I hope this review helps!",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=48966083,23584,requirement,neutral,functional

I stopped using MyFitnessPal a few years ago because it was just too much work to enter foods. I've returned because I am using Fitbit and Fitbit is more inadequate in that arena. 
Example of MyFitnessPal weakness: entering recipes into recipes. Let's say you have various ways of preparing ground turkey; burgers, meat loaf, tacos, spaghetti sauce, etc. the basic turkey seasoning would be one recipe and the sauce might be another. In these cases it would be  more efficient to include one recipe into another. This could have multiple variations and builds on the basic. A somewhat recursive recipe builder. Salads would be another less complex example. 
Either, it's not possible in MyFitnessPal or it's really NOT intuitive. I haven't found a way to do this. Someone, please let me know if you've found out how.
One more thing... foods don't transfer to Fitbit; only total calories and it's not a two way street. Why Fitbit allows this predatory relationship, I have no idea. Fitbit is much more accurate on calories spent and caloric balance.

The biggest advantage is that it has huge database of food so tracking calories is much easier. I've used couple of other apps for diet tracking where I couldn't find many foods so had to create my own foods. Here I didn't have to create my own food. Also has lot of useful blogs. 
One clear disadvantage is that the database for calories burnt by doing exercise is very very poor. I've been exercising for many years and have my own database so I'm using that. But not many people will have that. So the developer must work on this.
Then the calories adjustment for walking, running and stairs climbing doesn't seem to be as good as other apps. 
Further it needs to have data capturing from other fitness apps even from competitor apps.
It would be good have direct link with other social media. Although I don't use it, other users may find it useful.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=469222161,47819,requirement,neutral,non-functional

As per usual, along with a few unnecessary changes they've added banner ads right in the middle of the food diary blocking a lot of the screen. It's fairly common for apps to introduce ads after its gained in popularity, especially for 'free apps'. However the blatant ad positioning here greatly impacts the usability of the app and is a careless design.  I expected more consideration from an app endorsed by Under Armour. 

Personally I haven't found the update worth the inconvenience and annoyance of having an ad staring at you every time you log in, so if you haven't already, I wouldn't bother. 

Also, the designers have unnecessarily increased the spacing around the food entries meaning you now have to scroll significantly in order to see your whole day. I don't see any benefit to the extra white spacing and seems a wasteful use of a real real estate. This is of course made worse by the fact the middle inch is now taken up by ads as well making the app cumbersome to deal with.

A photo of the item in Google > Images brought me here, and after a minute of two of mooching around I downloaded the app.
It's a great place to find so many things, but my gripe is down to the way I (like many others) want to use it.
- I'm looking for a 'thing' to buy.
- I type the name of the 'thing' into the search area and I'm presented with hundreds of photos - Awesome!
- Many of those photos are posted by online and physical real world retailers - Double Awesome!
- Sadly, clicking many of the links associated with the photos results in landing on error pages, unrelated sites etc. not the retailer's site/Amazon/eBay as you would expect.
My wife has also found this to be the case, so it's not just me.

1.) I have the ""picked for you"" setting turned off, but I still keep seeing a ton of pins on my main feed from boards that I do not follow :\ 
2.) It is a major task to delete pins that I no longer want on my boards. Sometimes I like to do a ""spring cleaning"" of my boards by going through and deleting hundreds of pins that I don't like anymore, but it takes forever because I can only delete one pin at a time, and it's a whole process just to delete them. I would love if there were a ""select pins"" option where I can select more than one pin at a time and delete/move them to another board all at the same time.

You got rid of the like button and now I legit have to make a new bored whenever I fine something I remotely like. Also what's with this 200,000 pin limit? I'm fairly new as I had joined last year and I've never heard of that. To be honest that's extremely stupid as I use Pinterest as a source of motivation and to get my brain thinking with writing prompts and drawing ideas. If I got to that point that means basically losing everything I have built up until now. So here are my suggestions by you know of course I don't expect you to use them considering you would probably go against everyone's wants and keep on making it horrible. But that is on you. 

1. You should bring back the like button. It helped me know (at least) when I've already pinned something or seen something. Also because it put all the likes into a little folder for you to go throw later on. 

2. You should remove the 200,000 pin limit. Like why is that even a thing? That really does make it hard for people who use your app for inspiration. 

3. Less adds. Honestly since this has been getting updating more and more I'm seeing more and more adds. Not even adds for things I would be interested in anyways. Just random pointless adds. 

Anyways these are just my ideas and I'm sure other people have more ideas and have a better way of explaining why for each one, but I would like to be a voice to help bring back that gosh darn like button.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=553704666,18665,requirement,Negative,functional

With every update I use this site less and less! Now with no more likes, I probably will barely use it anymore. I used likes to like stuff I saw quickly, then I'd put them into their specific boards later when I had more time. What's the point of having a Likes Board if it takes exactly the same amount of time as just putting it in the right board in the first place? We can make our own private boards!

OMG stop with the horrible updates!! If I'm pinning something from my likes, why would I need to be reminded every single time that I've already saved it to my likes? Isn't that what the red heart is for?! And get rid of those RIDICULOUS white circles please!

-----
This app is getting so frustrating! I woke up to find the You and News tabs are all together now. So not only do I have to know what other people have liked and saved, I have to sift through all that just to get to my own notifications. It makes it so hard to know what kind of an impact you have on your followers. Plus, I don't want anyone to know what pins I've liked, that's what pinning them is for. It was so much better when you took the like button away so I didn't have to pin everything to a secret board.

Another thing that is kind of making me want to give up, the ""picked for you"" pins. There's more of those than pins from people I actually CHOSE to follow. I miss so much stuff I'd have saved because I have to go through so much I don't even care to see. The pins are generally similar to what I search it they're the mediocre version, and they're the pins I saw when I did the search in the first place.

I come back to pinterest this week and find there are a lot of features i used to use and love are now gone. For instance, the ""like"" button. The name or company that shared a pin is no longer under the pin itself. Before i took the break from Pinterest i had noticed my notifications no longer showed me EXACTLY what others repinned of mine. It just told me that a pinterest user repinned my pin to this album. What pin? I liked seeing what people thought was interesting or enjoyed out of my pins. Now I don't know. That's weird. And i really dont care what my friends pin on their boards IN MY NOTIFICATIONS. I follow them, don't I? So why aren't their pins showing up in my pin feed? Why did these changes happen? I have been waiting patiently for the notification one to change back to what it used to be cause i now find it odd and annoying. And the new changes of the like button (so I don't have to read it right away or commit it to a board) and the names of those i follow appearing under the pins they share. Please stop changing this app ""for the better"". I don't enjoy it as much as i used to. 

One positive note. I like the ""i tried it"" feature. It's helpful to hear how others benefited from the pin or found it not useful. 

Otherwise, give us back the Pinterest we all know and love and please use focus groups with REAL obsessed Pinterest users and not just web designers/marketers or whomever you are using for advice. 

Thank you.

I drive for a living, and Waze is my go-to GPS app, even though it has a few flaws. For starters, it sometimes (maybe 10% of time) gives me directions that make no sense. I've messed with the settings for fastest/shortest route, but it doesn't seem to matter. Also, there have been a lot of glitches lately, like login/account problems, crashing, and screen malfunctions. For those reasons, I knocked off one star. 

I knocked off another star because of poor service, poor updates, and poor communication, as I've emailed Waze a number of times only to get a generic, computerized response in return. 

All in all, it's a very good navigation tool. It will get you where you want to go, and with the help of other wazers, it will notify you of potential problems along your route, which is the main attraction to the app. But it has the potential to blow every other GPS app out there completely out of the water.

 First of all they have a long standing audio issue is that they NEED to put a delay when their audio starts up in Bluetooth.
 On certain OEM car radios, mine included (it's a Subaru) the first part of the audio gets cut off because Waze starts too early. This was noted in a feature request, the response is that is it is ""a car manufacturer'sissue"". What do they expect me to do?, replace my car stereo? 
 
 When I approached DC , the uplink to their Database must have cut out because I got a warning that there was no data connection.I reset my iPhone and tried again , with no success.I had to switch to Google Maps to complete my trip.
 
 On the return trip, Waze could not compute a route to my home.Again , I resorted to Google Maps, which worked fine.When I went back to Waze , which later was able to figure out how to get to my house, itcaused my iPhone 6S to overheat and go into thermal shutdown.At that point I removed it from its Otterbox case so that it could run a bit cooler. 
 
 The final insult came when it routed me through GW bridge and the LIE rather than alternate routes to get to my home on Long Island.This added HOURS to my return trip.Without using any Nav system I would have taken an alternate route which I suspect would have been no worse and most likely much better.
 
 Due to these problems I will not consider Waze for any long trips and will use a different Nav app or a dedicated GPS.

If I forget, having the GPS on kills the battery in my aging 5s. Sometimes location services stay on even with the song and dance, and I have to turn off location services in settings.

37971,Waze,177466486,Loftis002,2017-05-06 0:00:00,United States,4.22,3,Something Changed!!!,I've been using this app for a long time and most of the time I use it daily. I have a 45 minute drive to work and most of it is interstate travel so I use the app to see if there are any traffic jams between home and work before I leave. It works great for that. What I've noticed changing is Waze won't redirect me around the traffic as well as it did before. Being familiar with the route I have to choose the way to go myself.  Three days ago I was going to a destination that I've never been to and waze took me right to a traffic jam on the interstate and there were several exits I could have taken to go around it. Starting to wonder if there is a better app out there.,https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=177466486,38159,other,negative,

It doesn't always show you the quickest routes to avoid queuing traffic. 
Another annoyance is when the app guesses your going home etc if you tap 'go' it should just show you the route instead of showing another box to tap 'go' again. 
Other than that, routes are better than Google maps

1. Let me choose to see the picture of a friend which I put myself in the iphone's Contacts app. Certain people keep changing their profile picture, it's funny but necessarily helpful.
2. Let me choose to rename a group chat just for me, without the others seeing it. This is quite essential for group discussions. One example among others: I have a group discussion chat with my wife, my sister and her husband. The only name we can give to this group is something in common, so: ""Their family name-Our family name"". It would be much better that we be able to choose to see only their family name and they see only ours. This is true with all in-laws but also friend's couples, or even group chat when you haven't chosen the group's name (you could end up with 2 group chats having the same name, for example).
3. Please let us write messages to someone for whom we only have the phone number, and is not in My Contacts.

NICE TO HAVE
4. Please let me create a ""one-off"" group discussion, not meant to last, i.e. do not force me to give a name to the group discussion, which makes it too formal.
5. Specific alerts/notifications linked to keywords. For example, let's say I am part of a big chat group, there are too many messages so I put on silent, but i still would like to receive a notification if someone writes my first name or nick name.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=224236014,46209,requirement,positive,functional

Love this app's new filters and soooo many other things, but could we replace the camera button with the contacts button? I find the camera button quite useless.

Another thing, one of my group chats show 2 contacts for the same person when you see the group's info about the participants. If you go down the list of participants in the group, the would be 2 people with the number 9756 4835, and another 2 people with 8045 7265(for example). I know my explanation might not be that clear but please try to fix this:)

Also, could we have the same colours for the same contact names? Different colours for the same contact names in different chat groups are a bit confusing. 

Before I forget, could we include a search function that lets you search for messages at a specific time, or day please?

Last thing, when we want to clear our chat's messages in the part in the settings which tell you about each of your chat's specific storage usage for each chat group, and lets you choose to delete only certain parts of the chat, could we add the option of not deleting starred messages? As in an option that lets you delete your selected ones(e.g. Text & photos) but cancels out your starred messages, resulting in only unstarred messages being deleted(in this case would be unstarred texts & unstarred photos). 

Overall, I am really happy with this awesome app and keep up with the great work:)",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=577628493,48399,requirement,positive,functional

 I used to love the Fitbit app on my iPhone, but don't like the new dashboard at all--and with the 2.26 update, there is no way to go back to the old dashboard.
 Although I prefer the simplicity of the old dashboard, I could actually get used to the new dashboard if, when I look at stats for a previous day it would show all the stats for that day.The way it is now, when I look at yesterday's stats, the upper tile shows steps/active minutes/miles for yesterday, but the lower tiles are stuck on today's statistics for sleep, exercise, etc.Very inconsistent, confusing, and counter-intuitive!
 Update--getting used to the ""new"" dashboard even though I still prefer the older one...but now with the latest version--Fitbit has added a ""guidance"" option at the bottom middle of the screen that is only a link to ""fitstar"" which requires a purchase and I have absolutely no use for. No way to get rid of it. 
 Another annoyance is the notifications icon on the bottom right. Mine is littered with notifications about meeting my exercise goal-going back several months and no way to delete these notifications. Why would I care that I was close to meeting my daily exercise goal two months ago. 
 Really wish Fitbit would get back to the basics and give me an app where I can check my daily/weekly/monthly progress at a glance without all the extra meaningless features.",https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewUsersUserReviews?userProfileId=17862717,26793,other,negative,

 I use the Charge 2 most of the time, but cut over to the Charge HR when engaged in activities that could scratch the face of the Charge 2, such as gardening.
 
 Recently, I have found that changing back to the Charge 2 and synching causes the steps counted while wearing the Charge HR to be ignored in the total daily steps, reverting back to what the total was before the Charge HR was used.Subsequent synching of the Charge HR causes it to revert back to the same daily total as displayed in the App.However, when you look at the hourly graph of steps taken for the day, the steps from both trackers are clearly still displayed.It is just the total daily steps that is wrong.

You need the option to have several people and associated tracker on the same account. Which brings me to: It can't track sex as activity. I found I can add an activity using the website dashboard. But this is so many steps for something I really should already have automatically logged. it's basically high core moderate activity, so it registers as a larger amount of steps at once than walking around the house.

 There are times when it will tell my that I have to get 88 steps to win the hour. And other times it will tell me to go for a stroll and not tell me how many. I really wish it told you how many more you had to get every time.
